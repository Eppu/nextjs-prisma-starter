# Next.js & Prisma Starter Template ðŸ¦“

This is a blog starter template for Next.js. It has features like user signup and login, as well as adding and removing posts.

It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for communication with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, and [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for user authentication.

Easily adaptable to Static Site Generation, if SSR does not work for you!

### These docs are still a WIP, e.g. installation might be difficult.
